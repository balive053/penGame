# A quick and simple game which can be played PvP against a friend or Single Player vs. a snarky AI bot of questionable intelligence (but be careful, he does play with a decent strategy)

A simple game where two players compete by picking up pencils to avoid being the one who takes the last pencil. Each turn from 1-3 pencils must be picked up till none remain. The player who picks up the last pencil loses.
Can be played in either Single Player mode vs the AI bot, or in multiplayer mode against a friend.

### Settable features:
  1) Player 1 (and Player 2) name(s)
  2) Starting amount of pencils on board
  3) Single or multiplayer

### Todo:
  - add feature to allow player option to add pencils instead of only removing pencils to make game more challenging

### Known bugs:
  - None
